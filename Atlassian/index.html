Our company wants to switch to data driven product development. To make this initiative work we need to design a reusable function capable of collecting and delivering UI analytics to the backend server.

To get you started we created a small snippet of code which should explain how we intend to use that API function.

```js
// This is the example of component to be instrumented using the function
class Component {
  constructor() {
    // this is where the unction could be called for example
    sendAnalyticsEvent(event);
    setTimeout(this.init, 100);
  }
  init() {
    sendAnalyticsEvent(event);
  }
}
```

Your goal is to implement the sendAnalyticsEvent(event) API function.

```js

const sendAnalyticsEvent = (event) => {
  const timer;
  let failureCount = 0;
  let isUnavailable = false;
  let lastFailedTime = 0;


  if(isUnavailable)  {
    if(Date.now() - lastFailedTime > 10000) {
      isUnavailable = false;
      makeApiCall();
    } else {
      console.log('sorry the server is unavailable');
      return;
    }
  } else {
    makeApiCall();
  }

  while(failureCount < 3) {
    
  }
     doRequest(event).then(({ok, status, json}) => {
    if(status === 200) {
      console.log('sucess')
    } else if(status === 500) {
      // trying again 
      failureCount++;
      lastFailedTime = Date.now();
      if(failureCount >= 3) {
        isUnavailable = true;
      }
      if(!isUnavailable) {
         setTimeout(() => {
        makeApiCall();
      }, 1000)
      }  
    }
  })
  }

 
};
```

When using an API, you would need to POST those analytics events down to the backend via some `/analytics` end-point. To get you started weâ€™ve developed a simple mock of the server API abstraction.
Feel free to change this implementation.

```js
const doRequest = (events) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    return resolve({
      ok: true,
      status: 200,
      json: () => Promise.resolve({}),
    });
  });
};
```

Server returns 200 HTTP code and empty response when API worked fine.

Server returns 500 HTTP code and empty response when server has experienced an error.

```js
const doRequest = (event) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    return resolve({
      ok: false,
      status: 500,
      json: () => null,
    });
  });
};
```
