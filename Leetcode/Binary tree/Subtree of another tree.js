// Subtree of Another Tree
// Solved 
// Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

// A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

// Example 1:



// Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5], subRoot = [2,4,5]

// Output: true
// Example 2:



// Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,null,6], subRoot = [2,4,5]

// Output: false
// Constraints:

// 0 <= The number of nodes in both trees <= 100.
// -100 <= root.val, subRoot.val <= 100
